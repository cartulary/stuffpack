This is a collection of code mostly written by Eitan Adler.

Some of this code is meant to solve a one time problem, some as an interesting exercise for myself, and other code as a homework assignment. Improvements and comments are always welcome.

A lot of this code was done quickly or off-the-cuff so the code style is not always the best. However pointers are always welcome.

If you see any bugs, problems, or any other improvements please email me or submit an issue report.
